Hey! 
This repository is my proyect for my Computer Science Internal Assessment when I did the International Baccalaureate. 

It is a web where the user can input a sudoku and the program will return the solution. It also gives the user the option to download said solution in a .pdf file. 

- DATABASE: It was mandaroty to include a database so there is a user LogIn/Register function implemented in PHP. I have my own database with MySQL and xampp but feel free to change that information. 

LAST EDIT: I will not update this proyect anymore as I am working on better things. This was my first ever "big proyect" therfore there are a lot of things that could be improved but I will not spend anymore time on it.
